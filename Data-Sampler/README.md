# Sentence Sampler

This project provides a script to sample sentences from a CSV file using the Nilsimsa algorithm to calculate the similarity between sentences.

## Installation

To install the required packages, run the following command:

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
## Usage

To run the script, use the following command:

```
python nilsimsa_sent.py input_file.csv output_file.csv
```

Replace `input_file.csv` with the path to your input CSV file, and `output_file.csv` with the path where you want to save the output CSV file.
